# PyFSPro - Python Frame Sequence Processor
Multi purpose realtime frame sequence and video processor for a wide range of applications including:
* [Schlieren Videography](https://hackaday.io/project/9034-schlieren-videography) using the Moir√©-effect.
* Realtime Astronomical video processing for live presentations.
* Software image intensifier (night vision).
* Weak video signal detection and enhancement.

## Main features
* Resizable ring buffer for image "stacking".
* High accuracy processing core using floating point maths for image processing.
* Input from Camera, Image sequence or Video file.
* Output to Screen, Image sequence or Video file.
* Pre- and Postprocessing chains for basic image enhancement functions.
* Vectorscope for the visualization of small changes in video stream.
* Built-in pattern generator for Schlieren Videography.
* Parameters can be set through command line options.
* Most Parameters can be changed on the fly via keyboard shortcuts.
* framestacker.py library can be re-used in other projects and only requires Numpy.

## Image enhancement functions
* Image integration (rolling average)
* Image difference to fixed reference (dark) frame or rolling average
* Automatic or manual gain and offset
* Histogram Equalization
* Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)
* Blurring
* DeNoising
* Pseudo Color

## Requirements
* Tested with Python 2.7, not ported to Python 3 yet!
* Numpy (tested with version 
* OpenCV with Python bindings (tested with version 2.4.9)
* [Scikit-Video](http://www.scikit-video.org) this library is needed as a workaround for a video recording bug in Linux OpenCV 2.4
On Debian / Ubuntu based systems the requirements can be installed with the following commands:  
sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-opencv  
sudo pip install sk-video

## Usage
Installation: Clone or download PyFSPro  
Run the program: python ./PyFSPro.py  
Press the 'h' key for a list of keyboard shortcuts in the terminal window.  
Run python ./PyFSPro.py --help for a list of command line options.
